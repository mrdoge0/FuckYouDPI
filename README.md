# Fuck You, DPI!
Dynamically bypass deep packet inspection (DPI) in Android.

### What is it?
FuckYouDPI is a tool that dynamically bypasses Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) in Android.

### How does it work?
FuckYouDPI runs TPWS, and runs the internet connection of user-specified target apps through that TPWS instance. That way, DPI is bypassed without other things like VPNs.
* TPWS is a tool that bypasses DPI for user-specified domains. Target domains are user-specified on FuckYouDPI too.

### Requirements
* An Android device rooted with Magisk, KernelSU or APatch.
* KsuWebUI (only for Magisk).

### How to install?
FuckYouDPI can be installed just like any other Magisk/KernelSU/APatch module.
